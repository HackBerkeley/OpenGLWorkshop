*3D Workshop!*

In this 3D Workshop, we will go over the basics of how to program interactive 3D applications, whether it be on the web, on mobile, or a native application. The goal of this workshop is to introduce the ideas of "thinking" in 3D and how modern 3D frameworks display those dazzling images on our monitors.

A rough outline is as follows:

* Part I: Geometry
    * Drawing a triangle!
* Part II: Complicated Geometry
    * Drawing a dragon!
* Part III -> Part V: Transformations
    * Here I hope everyone becomes intimately familiar with 3D transformations. Things like:
        * Order of operations
        * Pushing / popping matrices
        * Concatenation of transformations
* Part VI: User interaction
    * Ray picking: Transforming 2D clicks into a 3D world


After the workshop, I will update this README with full coding instructions on how to follow along at home
