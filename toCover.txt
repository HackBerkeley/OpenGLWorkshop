I want to cover:

outputting geometry (vertices, shapes [triangles, quads, etc]):
	-retained vs immediate mode:
		-retained you give them all the vertices, and it rips through them on the GPU
		-immediate: you tell it right now to draw, and it draws

transformations on geometry
	-big section!!
	-rotations about any axis
	-loading from identity -> starting over essentially
	-translations
	-concatenation of operations
		-what is the difference of rotating first, and then translating vs
		translating, then rotating
	-Pushing and Popping


user interaction (clicking, ray picking, etc)

update function
